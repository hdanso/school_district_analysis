# PyCity School Analysis

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to collect, prepare, and analyze key subsets of student data for several public and charter high schools. Using Pandas within the Jupyter notebook, subsets of the cleaned data was analyzed to compare and contrast specific groups.

## Summary of Analysis and Key Findings

After cleaning and preparing the data, the summary statistics for the new student DataFrame was generated, which provides a big-picture analysis of the information included in the dataset. 

Key discoveries within this analysis include: the summary statistics for the dataframe (includes the count, mean, standard deviation, min, max and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartile of data for the grade, reading scores, math scores, and school budget), mean math score (64.68) and minimum reading score (10.5).

Drilling into the data included performing the targetted analysis for smaller subsets. This type of analysis is useful for getting information that is more specific to natural groups within a data set.

Key discoveries within this analysis include: the mean reading score specific to the 9th grade is lower than the mean reading scores of all students (69.24 vs. 72.36), but the mean math score specific to the 9th grade is higher than the mean math scores of all students (66.59 vs. 64.68) the reading scores only for 10th graders at Dixon High school, and the average reading score for all grade 11 and 12 students (74.9)

Finally, subsets of the data was compared by creating and analyzing aggregations within the data.

Key discoveries within this analysis include: the school budget for public schools is higher than charter schools ($911,195.56 vs. $872,625.66), the school with the most students is Montgomery High School (2038) and the school with the least students is Chang High School 171), and the average math score for charter schools is higher than public schools for grades 9-11 but lower for grade 12 (gr9 - 70 vs 64, gr10 - 66 vs 63, gr11 - 68 vs 59, gr12 - 60 vs 63).

## Next Steps: Additional Analysis on the Dataset

Additional analysis that would be worthwhile would be to analyze school budget per grade to make informed decisions on how to allocate funds to each grade for future cohorts, and a comparision of summary statistics across all grades.
